# Free Security Scanning Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Quick Start - 100% Free Security Scanning**

This guide provides a complete free security scanning solution for your financial applications without requiring paid licenses.

## 🔓 **Free Gitleaks Options**

### Option 1: Community License (Recommended)

```bash
# Trigger a manual security scan
# Go to: Actions → Security Scan → Run workflow
# Select: scan_type = "all"
# Click: Run workflow
```
